Desc: This program will show the recent revision history of the Wikipedia article input by the User. It shows no more than 30 of the most recent revisions. The program will exit with Error Code 0 if the program is successful. The program will exit with a different error code if an issue arises.

Error Code 1. There is no User input.
Error Code 2. The article title input by the User doesn't exist.
Error Code 3. There is a network error.

The GUI version of the program will not exit if one of these errors occur, rather the error will be displayed in the window and the User will be able to type something different or check their network connection.

Run wikiChanges_main.py to run the command line version.
